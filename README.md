## Guides

- If you haven't installed Rails, let's install Rails first:

```bash
gem install rails --no-ri --no-rdoc
```

- Check if Rails is installed

```bash
rails -v
```

- After Rails is successfully installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gotcha-io/kyosei_academy.git
cd kyosei_academy
bundle install
bin/rails db:migrate
bin/rails s
```
